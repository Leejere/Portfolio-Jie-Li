          ## WHAT IS THIS MODEL? <br />

          This model simulates the spread of an infectious virus in a simple
          town. The model can simulate residents' going to work, school, and
          other places while transmitting the virus, or staying at home when
          getting symptomatic, and becoming sick, recover, or die. By setting
          parameters to control the town's land use and demographics makeup,
          people's behavior, and the virus's characteristics, the model can
          simulate the spread of the virus and output the number of infected,
          recovered, and dead people in the process. [Play with the tool in
          Netlogo](../assets/projects/covid%20in%20Healthville/netlogo.html)<br />

          Agent-based models like this are suitable for a use case like this for
          the following reasons:<br /><br />

          - Ability to capture the complexity of human behavior and
          interactions. Disease transmission is a complex process that involves
          many factors, such as demography, behavior, and virology. Compared to
          top-down models, agent-based models are able to capture these factors
          and simulate the interactions between them.<br />

          - Customizability for testing out different scenarios. Agent-based
          models help us understand or anticipate disease transmission scenarios
          under different demographical, behavioral, and virological settings.
          Such understanding may otherwise be difficult to obtain from real-life
          data.<br />

          Users should be cautioned that agent-based models are not guaranteed
          to be true representations of reality. They are only models, and they
          are only as good as the assumptions and parameters that go into them.
          However, two points may be made to address this concern:<br />

          - Agent-based models like this are highly adaptible. Once we have set
          up a framework like this one, we can adjust the model assumptions to
          fit the real-life situation.<br />
          - Agent-based models like this can also be validated against real-life
          data. After this validation, we are more confident in the validity of
          the model and better trust the simulation result for scenarios that
          deviate from the real-life situation.<br />

          ## HOW THE MODEL WORKS<br />

          ### The Town<br />

          The "town" is made of a 64x64 grid of patches or "cells", and each
          cell represents a land-use type. There are four land-use types:<br />

          - Schools. The town as a number of schools (controlled by the user)
          randomly placed within the town.<br />
          - Workplaces. Workplaces are where some residents go to work. The
          workplaces are more likely to be placed near *schools* and other *work
          centers* (the number of which controlled by the user).<br />
          - Homes. Homes are where residents live and the density of which is
          controlled by the user.<br />

          ### Residents and Their Routines<br />

          Each household corresponds to a home. Within each household, the model
          assumes that there are three types of residents: students, workers,
          and non-workers, and they follow different daily routines. Users may
          control the sizes of the households in terms of three types of
          residents.<br />

          - Students go to school every day. After school, they may or may not
          go to another location close to their school or home.<br />
          - Workers go to work every day. After work, they may or may not go to
          another location to perform a side routine close to their work or
          home.<br />
          - Non-workers (primarily pensioners) do not go to school or work, but
          they may or may not go to some location to perform a side routine
          close to their homes.<br />

          Residents may choose to avoid their primary and side routines and stay
          at home because of the disease. There are three types of
          "personalities":<br />

          - **"Careless"** residents will go out and perform their routines
          normally unless they are *more than* mildly symptomatic.<br />
          - **"Cautious"** residents will not go out if any of their household
          members becomes symptomatic.<br />
          - The other residents will stay at home if they themselves are
          symptomatic, regardless of whether their household members are
          symptomatic.<br />

          ### Infections<br />

          Infections happen whenever different residents are in the same cell
          during their routines and in-household. In public places, the
          likelihood of a susceptible resident to catch the disease is dependent
          on 1. the number of infected residents in the same cell, and 2. the
          ratio of infected residents to total residents, and 3. a factor set by
          the user. Specifically:<br />

          - Infection probability is exponential to the ratio of infected
          people, all else staying constant: `infection-ratio = (exp (multiplier
          * (sick-ratio - 1))) / (multiplier)`, where `sick-ratio` is the ratio
          of infected people at the same cell.<br />
          - In the above equation, `multiplier` is determined by the absolute
          number of infected people and the user-defined factor: `multiplier =
          1.2 / (how-infectious * num-sick-people)`, where `num-sick-people` is
          the number of infected people, and `how-infectious` is the
          user-defined factor.<br />

          In-household transmission is more straightforward. If any household
          member becomes infected, the probability of their household members
          getting infected is directly controlled by the user (usually very high
          close to 1).<br />

          Masks have the ability to lower the rate of disease transmission in
          public places. The effectiveness of masks is determined by the
          user.<br />

          ### Disease Progression<br />

          At the start of the circle, everyone is **"susceptible"**. If a
          resident becomes infected, she enters her "incubation period" or the
          "latent" stage. She gets randomly assigned the number of days for her
          incubation period and her symptomatic period, according to a normal
          distribution defined by the user. She also gets assigned whether her
          symptoms will be **""mild"**, **"severe"**, or neither, according to
          certain probabilities according to the user.<br />

          While a resident or her household member is sick, she may or may not
          continue with her normal routines, depending on whether she is
          "careless", "cautious", or neither.<br />

          Each day, the model re-calculates days to determine if an infected
          residents should start to be symptomatic, or exit the disease period.
          By "existing", most residents "recover". However, if a resident has
          severe symptoms, there is a probability of her dying, determined by
          the user.<br />

          After a resident recovers, she enters a period of immunity, the length
          and standard deviation of which are determined by the user. During
          immunity, the residents still may get infected, but the likelihood of
          getting infected is lowered, controlled by the `how-immune` variable
          set by the user. The decrease rate of infection of one-time exposures
          are calculated based on `how-immune` and `immune-days`.<br />

          ## HOW TO USE IT<br />

          To use the model, the user may choose to tune each input on the user
          interface, setting params to set up the town, make the demographics,
          and define the disease.<br />

          After setting the parameters, users can hit "Reset" to build out the
          town. Then, users may hit the "Start / Stop Simulation" to start or
          pause the simulation. Each "tick" in the model represents one day.<br />

          In the grid visualization, the "flag" symbols represent schools, and
          "computer" symbols represent workplaces. The dots represent workers,
          and arrows represent students or non-workers. The gray color
          represents susceptibility or immunity. The yellow color represents the
          incubation period, whereas the red color indicates that a resident is
          symptomatic.<br />

          Three monitors left of the grid show the real-time population, total
          cases, and total deaths since day 1. On the right, three plots show
          the daily new cases, new deaths, and active severe cases by day. These
          metrics are what people are most interested in during a pandemic.<br />

          ## THINGS TO NOTICE<br />

          We noticed a few emergent behaviors in the model:<br />

          - Infections typically reach an acute peak and then decline within the
          first few weeks of "patient zero". Different demographical and
          behaviral settings may lead to slightly different intensity or
          duration of this peak, but such an acute peak occurs in most cases.<br />
          - After the first peak, subsequent peaks (if any) are usually much
          less acute.<br />
          - The patterns of subsequent infections peaks are highly dependent on
          *immunity* characteristics.<br />
          - Immunity: If immunity is absolute within a certain period, latter
          peaks are usually less acute, or even non-existent.<br />
          - Immune asynchrony: The deviation of immunity duration among people
          is very important. If people are "synchronous" in their immunity,
          later peaks are usually more acute, because the a higher ratio of
          population will reach susceptibility after recovery at the same time.
          Conversely, if people are "asynchronous" in their immunity, later
          peaks are usually less acute, and under some circumstances we will
          observe the second peak being dragged out forever.<br />
          - Under circumstances where immunity is not absolute and immunity
          duration is asynchronous, the disease is not likely to be eradicated,
          but we will observe cycles of infection peaks and valleys, although
          later peaks are usually slightly less acute than their predecessor.<br />

          ## THINGS TO TRY<br />

          Users are encouraged to test out different demographical, behavioral,
          and virological settings to see how they affect the spread of the
          disease. Meanwhile, users are encouraged to validate and extend the
          model.<br />

          - This model provides a framework where residents performing daily
          routines while infecting each other, and may refrain from performing
          routines when getting sick. This framework may be easily extended to
          simulate more complicated situations, e.g., more diverse routine
          choices, vaccination, government-enforced lockdowns, etc.<br />
          - Users may validate the model after extending it, and then move back
          and forth between model validation and extension, until they are
          satisfied with the model's ability to simulate the real-world spread
          of the disease. Then, the model becomes a useful tool to simulate
          credible scenarios and for policy makers to make informed decisions. </md-block
